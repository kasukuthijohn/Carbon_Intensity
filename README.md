# Carbon_Intensity

1) I have created a simple leaflet map.
2) The dimensions of the map is (0,0) for that tha locator located at the center of the world map.
3) I have created geojson data and add to the html file in a script tag(like internal java script).
4) I had created one html file with in the html file i have used internall css to perform styles to map and internal java script to load geojson data and perform operations.
5) The geojson file contains locators which are displayed on the map on a particular country.
6) When we click on the locator that displays country name and corrosponding carbon intensity of a country.
